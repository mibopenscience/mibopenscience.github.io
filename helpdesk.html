          In the past researchers at HvA could seek help from the data steward and the methodologist. The Helpdesk formalizes those functions and extends these by offering support on qualitative research and open access publishing. The Helpdesk will be able to monitor the types of questions it receives and use that information to inform activities such as training, FAQs, infrastructure (might be software), and acquiring new expertise. We hope that the Helpdesk will increase the visibility of the services by the data steward, qualitative and quantitative methodologists, and the librarian.

        <h5>Pilot phase: September 2019 - July 2020</h5>
        <p>
          The Helpdesk will start functioning when the new academic year 2019-2020 begins. In July 2020 we will evaluate how well we did and how we can improve things. The findings, conclusions and new plans will be made public through our website and other HvA channels.          
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5>Why we use Open Science Framework (OSF)</h5>
        <p>
          OSF provides a platform for collaboration on which relevant documents may be downloaded and kept. Once relevant documents are uploaded on OSF, these may be preregistered and made public without much additional effort. The use of OSF is part of the pilot phase.
