#### Archiving your research data as a data package in a repository like UvA/HvA Figshare facilitates verification of research results. Furthermore, it is not only protected against corruption and loss, but also becomes findable and citable via a DOI. And it gives you the chance to intelligently open up (part of) your data to facilitate reuse.

### Why is it important and what are benefits for you?
- By archiving a data package in a data repository you make your data more FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable
- Just like publications, data that you have collected is research output too. By depositing it in a data repository you increase your research output (via UvA/HvA Figshare information about your dataset will be automatically registered in PURE)
- You increase the visibility of your work
- By describing your data (metadata) and providing conditions for reuse you clarify what other can and cannot do with your data
- Your data are protected against corruption and loss
- You facilitate verification of your research results

### How and when?

#### Starting points
- Every scientific publication and PhD-dissertation are accompanied by a data package
- Other situations where archiving could be relevant:
1. Upon completion of a research project, regardless of whether or not the data were used in a publication (especially when the data may be of use for a new project)
2. Upon completion of raw data collection to ensure secure storage and prevent loss or modification of the raw data (i.e. a locked or frozen version of your raw data)
3. 'Snapshots' of datasets from long-lasting cohort studies or registries that were used in a publication
- This archiving guidline is applicable to research projects for which AUAS bears responsibility
1. Concerning ‘WMO-plichtig’ studies: the sponsor (‘verrichter’) of the studie bear responsibility unless otherwise agreed (on paper)
2. Concering PhD-projects: depends on the arrangements made between AUAS and the university/institution where the doctorate is obtained
- The data package is archived before publication of a scientific article so the data package can be cited in the article via the persistent identifer (DOI) of the data package
- The data package concerns computer code, syntax, (raw) data, rich metadata, documentation and provenance information to be able to verify and replicate results, and to efficiently facilitate reuse
- (Raw) datasets don’t contain directly identifying personal (contact) information that are not needed for analyses. This information is stored in a ‘key file’ and - depending on whether the study is ‘WMO-plichtig’ (among other factors) - should be archived separately from the research data
- The aim to archive as much as possible in open, preferred formats. Data repositories can ensure the long-term preservation in terms of readability and accessibility of the data. See [here](https://dans.knaw.nl/en/about/services/easy/information-about-depositing-data/before-depositing/file-formats?set_language=en) for the preferred formats according to DANS
- The archiving package is in English


#### Data repository
- [UvA/HvA Figshare](https://uvaauas.figshare.com/auas) is the preferred (and strongly adviced) data repository of choice
- For more information about UvA/HvA Figshare, see [here](https://rdm.uva.nl/uva-hva-figshare/introductie.html)

#### Checklist data package
- See <a href="/files/UV_Datapackage_v02_concept.pdf" download="Checklist datapackage">the checklist</a> for more information about what to include in a data package
- This checklist may not be complete yet for 'WMO-plichtige' studies

#### Making data available for reuse: how FAIR are you?
- [How FAIR are your data checklist](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3405141)
- [Guidelines to FAIRify data management and make data reusable](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3368858)
- Results of the project [FAIR: geen woorden maar data](https://www.hva.nl/urban-vitality/gedeelde-content/projecten/overkoepelende-projecten/fair-data.html) will be made available asap
