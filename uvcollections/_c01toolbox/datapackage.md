#### Archiving research data facilitates the reuse and verification of research results. By depositing a dataset in a data repository like UvA/HvA Figshare, it is not only protected against corruption and loss, but also becomes findable and citable via a DOI. Openness of the data ranges from no access (closed) via 'only the metadata are open' to fully open.

### What is archiving?

### Why is it immportant?
By archiving a data package in a data repository you make your data more FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable

### What are benefits for you?
- Just like publications, data that you have collected is research output too. By depositing it in a data repository you increase your research output (via UvA/HvA Figshare your dataset will be automatically registered in PURE) and you increase the visibility of your work

### How and when?
- Every scientific publication and PhD-dissertation are accompanied by a data package
- The data package is archived before publication of a scientific artice so the data package can be cited in the article via the persistent identifer (DOI) of the data package
- The data package concerns computer code, syntax, (raw) data and documentation to be able to verify and replicate results, and to efficiently facilitate reuse
- Other situations where archiving could be relevant:
1. Upon completion of a research project, regardless of whether or not the data were used in a publication (especially when the data may be of use for a new project)
2. Upon completion of raw data collection to ensure secure storage and prevent loss or modification of the raw data (i.e. a locked or frozen version of your raw data)
- This archving guidline is applicable to research projects for which AUAS bears responsibility
1. Concerning 'WMO-plichtig' studies: the sponsor ('verrichter') of the studie bear responsibility unless otherwise agreed (on paper)
2. Concering PhD-projects: depends on the arrangements made between AUAS and the university/institution where the doctorate is obtained
- UvA/HvA Figshare is the preferred (and strongly adviced) data repository of choice
- (Raw) datasets don't contain directly identifying personal (contact) information that are not needed for analyses. This information is stored in a 'key file' and - depending on whether the study is 'WMO-plichtig' (among other factors) - should be archived separately.
- The aim to archive as much as possible in open, preferred formats. Data repositories can ensure the long-term preservation in terms of readability and accessibility of the data. See [here](https://rdm.uva.nl/en/looking-after/file-formats/file-formats.html) for more information.
- The checklist below may not be complete yet for 'WMO-plichtige' studies
