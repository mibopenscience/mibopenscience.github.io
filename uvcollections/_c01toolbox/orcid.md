## What is ORCID?
Do you worry about getting credit for your research because your name is common or you have publications under multiple aliases (e.g. married name and maiden name)? Do you struggle to keep track of all your research outputs? Are you annoyed by having to enter the same information over and over in manuscript and grant submission systems? Then create your own ORCID, short for ‘Open Researcher and Contributor iD’. What an ISBN is for books and DOI for articles and data, an ORCID is for researchers: a unique and persistent identifier that helps to distinguish you from others. ORCID is free, open, non-commercial and community-driven. It ensures that research systems and services know who you are and which research output belongs to you, even when you have a lot of (near) namesakes or change name or jobs. ORCID is not yet another research system (such as ISCAAC, Pure, Scopus, Google Scholar, Academia.edu, ResearchGate, Elsevier, Mendeley, etc.). Instead, having and using an ORCID allows you to automatically synchronize the research profiles that you already have, allowing you to spend your time doing research, instead of administrating it.

## Why is it important?
When you connect your research output to your ORCID, your works can always be attributed to you correctly. Next to journal articles, ORCIDs can also be connected to datasets, teaching materials, peer review activities and conference papers. When your research results are associated with an ORCID, the information about these resources can be exchanged effectively across databases, across countries and across academic disciplines. As an increasing number of publishers and funders incorporate or even require an ORCID in their submission process, having one will simplify your manuscript and grant submissions, while improving the visibility of your output and achievements.

#### Benefits
* Eliminates name ambiguity. research outputs and activities are correctly attributed to you and only you
* Improves the findability and the visibility of your research output. ORCiD is indexed by Google Scholar, and you can  link it to the author systems used in bibliographic databases like Web of Science and Scopus.  Research output associated with an ORCID can be found more effectively in such bibliographic databases
* Saves time. More and more of the systems you already use are connected with or even require ORCID. This should save time according to the principle “enter once, reuse often” 
* Follows you throughout your career no matter where you work
* Reliably and easily connects you with your contributions and affiliations.

## How do I get and use it?
See https://orcid.org/:
1. You can create your ORCID [here](https://orcid.org/register)
2. Use your ORCID in systems and platforms from grant application to manuscript submission, PURE and beyond 
3. The more information connected to your ORCID record, the more you’ll benefit from sharing your ORCID - so give the organizations you trust permission to update your record as well as adding your affiliations, emails, other names you’re known by, and more.

#### PURE and automated search
You can add your ORCID to your PURE-profile and enable automatic search in Elsevier Scopus with your ORCID to import your output in PURE.
