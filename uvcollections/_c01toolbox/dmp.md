#### A data management plan (DMP) is a digital document in which you describe what data you will collect, how you are going to store and manage the data during the project, and what will happen to the data after the project is finished.

## What is a data management plan and why is it important?
The website of [UvA/AUAS research data management](https://rdm.uva.nl/en/planning/planning.html) provides excellent information in both Dutch and English. Note that in case of collecting personal data a DMP is also an important document in light of the GDPR: it shows that you are 'in control' of your research data (if you also handle according to plan).

## When and how?
* It makes sense to write a DMP for each individual study in your project and it is most efficient to write your DMP after you have written your detailed research protocol/plan. Together with the research protocol/plan and (statistical) analysis plan, the DMP forms an important part of preparing your study.
* The AUAS works with [DMPonline](https://rdm.uva.nl/en/planning/dmponline/dmponline.html). Here you can choose the most commonly used templates (e.g., AUAS, ZonMw, NWO, SIA). For NWO and SIA the AUAS-template suffices.
* An increasing number of funders require a DMP. Requirement vary by funder. See [here](https://rdm.uva.nl/en/planning/funder-requirements/funder-requirements.html) for more information. Creating a DMP for practice-oriented AUAS research is also AUAS-policy regardless of funder requirements
* ZonMw in particular focusses on [FAIR data principles](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3405141) when creating a DMP. See [here](https://www.zonmw.nl/en/research-and-results/fair-data-and-data-management/) for information about ZonMw policy and procedurs regaring data management, FAIR and open science
* The 'final' version of your DMP should be checked by the supervisor or principal investigator. Together with the research protocol/plan and (statistical) analysis plan, the DMP could be preregistered
* During your study evaluate your DMP and make changes if necessary (with proper version control)
