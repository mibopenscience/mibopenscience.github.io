#### A (statistical) analysis plan, ‘SAP’ for short, describes how the data that you will collect will be handled.

### What is a (statistical) analysis plan?
A SAP describes how the data that you will collect will be handled, which includes preparing a dictionary (variable names, variable labels, details of how they were measured) error detection, cleaning, (graphical) summarization and reporting. The analysis of qualitative data is also likely to benefit from a written plan, describing the underlying (philosophical) approach and tackling details of e.g. triangulation, criteria for saturation and the selection of quotes. Each paper you write may require a separate SAP, or at least an adaptation of the main SAP.

### Why write a (statistical) analysis plan?
Crystal clear research objectives guide every data analysis. Before embarking on thinking about the analysis, revisit your objectives. Consider asking some of your colleagues, not directly involved in the project, to give their feedback. After all, some tunnel vision is common in many project teams. Discipline is needed to write your SAP early, even before you start collecting any data. But usually it pays off. Why?
1. Developing a SAP forces you to think about which data to collect in which format early on. It may also alert you to the fact that you may be planning to collect more data than you will be using in your analyses. This may burden participants and cause them to (selectively) drop out, which may spoil the overall validity of your study. [Here](http://www.dagitty.net/) is a link to a framework that helps you select the minimally needed set of confounding factors for a valid data-analysis. A recent example taught us that the statistical repair of poor treatment adherence in a trial would have required repeatedly measuring time-dependent confounders. Unfortunately, this had been forgotten and this repair became impossible. And, collecting personal data unnecessarily is unlawful.
2. SAP development may alert you that the necessary tools or statistical techniques are not available (in your favorite software). SAP development may also flag up that (more) statistical support needs to be organized by you or your supervisors.
3. A good SAP, and sticking to it, may save you a lot of time that would otherwise be spent analyzing the data in haphazard ways.
4. A good reason to put your SAP, once written, in the public domain early on is that the desire (unfortunately far from eradicated) to produce statistically significant results leads many investigators to torture their data until they confess ([P-hacking](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5122713/)). This approach distorts your work (then reviews, guidelines and patient care or services, and the scientific record as a whole) and should be avoided at all cost. This issue is explained in more detail in the chapter on preregistration[add hyperlink].

### How to write a (statistical) analysis plan?
If you are planning or conducting a randomized trial, look [here](https://cdn.jamanetwork.com/ama/content_public/journal/jama/936638/jsc170004t1.png?Expires=2147483647&Signature=Srd2JaU0SRQ1mcKE7Cwq1Mk3fR1CsNiTLBCgNX-e8bxmqkmsmzsHzB4Y4G3t0t9H-o5LW64ZF~HcY6Q9isLQ87ZQzkliRhkJaosbPRdMLQcs7k0QNC24QeZqex0x0IFP5vBjkH9ScQmgLr29QsxTwPQIXeL-DGZzsqftf--21~wA0Q53nTrYRfzexZ1xDMIyJDlx2cmmpmBh-ISka9S-OfKRGvijBr-qoQRe3tqqUp3~Q571AHJ61~ixP3OffwOJlQ43OMzC4bdeUnHUa7Ct66WQgSba62zLoIDWWMDt9Y00i396339jA0d4s2vFL6pPC1TkSi9orRoO957eBEvXRg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA) for excellent guidance on what should be in the SAP (55 items developed by an international Delphi panel). A good way to structure section 6 of the above document is this:
![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/rm_ch_sap_table1.BMP "Table 1")

Or this:
![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/rm_ch_sap_table2.BMP "Table 2")

In the latter table a separate legend explains exactly which analyses or variables are meant by the numbers. NA means ‘Not Applicable’. 
<br>

Try to prepare most of the syntax (code) before the data collection is complete or before the analyses start. 

To describe the contents of SAPs for all the different research designs is beyond the scope of this chapter. But do consult the [reporting guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/reportingguidelines) at equator network. They imply many study design and analysis items you can use in a SAP or study protocol. Some guidance on SAPs for non-trials may be found in PubMed by e.g. searching with this string: "statistical analysis plan" NOT (randomized OR randomised OR trial) or slight variations of it.
<br>

Two principles that may come in handy when thinking about data analysis are:
1. Design skeleton tables. Skeleton tables are complete tables to be presented in your publication. They have a title, row labels and the column entries are exactly spelled out, but the numbers in the cells are lacking. The data analysis will produce the contents of the cells in a very targeted way. That is, hardly any other numbers need to be produced. The same principle applies to graphs.
2.	Thoroughly discuss your SAP early on with your team members and make sure there is team consensus about the main issues and document decisions made (with reasons) in your logbook or meeting minutes. It can be quite frustrating to conduct many analyses only to be sent back to your computer by the project leader to redo the work because s/he wants to shift the emphasis of the analyses.
<br>

The collection and analysis of harms or adverse effects (in trials) is a particularly underdeveloped topic. Fortunately, guidance on how to deal with adverse effects in the analysis may be found here.
